How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it was easy to detect where the differences are in two files to inspect where the bug is.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    sometimes we have to check old files to detect bug so we can fix it

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    i love to have a controle of what i save beside sometimes it's easy to be clutterd with automatically saved .

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because git has been created for developer envirenment so you can track multiple files at once

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    first we need to navigate where the repository reside and lunch the command git log,
    after we'll see the commits listed in git and the finale step is to pick up two commits
    and use git diff + previous commit next commit to see the difference between them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because i know i can retrieve any changes that i have done in case i want to go back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
